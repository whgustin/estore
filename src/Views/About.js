            <p>I made this app based off of an internet tutorial from Quentin Watt as an ecommerce boiler plate app that that is best viewed from a mobile device. This app uses tailwind css for styling, axios to handle http requests as hooks, and is created within React. Make sure to view my portfolio for other completed projects, and view the others that are coming!</p>
